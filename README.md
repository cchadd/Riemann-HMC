# Riemann-HMC
Computation Statistics project

The project is based on [Riemann manifold Langevin and Hamiltonian MonteCarlo methods] from  Mark Girolami and Ben Calderhead (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.472.3640&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

**Abstract**: 
When one try to sample from a target *p*, one may use several MCMC Sampling method as (HM, MALA, Gibbs ...).However, when the dimension reaches medium or big size, these sampling methods demonstrate either poor acceptance ratios (when one deal with rejection methods) or high samples correlation. This paper proposes to use a Riemann manifold based approach to deal with these issues.

## Experiments
Demonstration of shortcomings of classic Monte Carlo methods

### Hasting Metropolis Sampler 
- Acceptance ratio
- Autocorrelation

### Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Sampler
- Influence of leapfrog integrator
- Acceptance ratio
- Influence of mass matrix
- Autocorrelation
