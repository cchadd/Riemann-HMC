# Riemann-HMC
Computation Statistics project

The project is based on [Riemann manifold Langevin and Hamiltonian MonteCarlo methods] from  Mark Girolami and Ben Calderhead(http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.472.3640&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

**Abstract**: 
When one try to sample from a target  $$ \pi$$
One of the main isssue when try to sample from probability laws in medium or high dimension

## Experiments (Demonstration of shortcomings of classic Monte Carlo methods)

### Hasting Metropolis Sampler 
- Acceptance ratio
- Autocorrelation

### Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Sampler
- Influence of leapfrog integrator
- Acceptance ratio
- Influence of mass matrix
- Autocorrelation
